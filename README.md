This API serves as the computing foundation for the client's system, managing user roles, assets, and transactions.

üöÄ Key Features
Role-Based Access Control (RBAC): Differentiates between Admin (Owner/Manager) and Buyer user roles.

Item Management: CRUD operations for digital assets (e.g., social media accounts). Write access (Create/Update/Delete) is restricted to the Admin role.

User Management: Buyers can manage their own profile; Admins can manage all users.

Wallet System: Includes a wallet_balance for each Buyer to facilitate purchases.

Secure Authentication: Uses JWT (JSON Web Tokens) via djangorestframework-simplejwt.

‚öôÔ∏è Local Setup and Installation
Prerequisites
Python 3.11+

PostgreSQL

Virtual Environment tool (venv recommended)

Setup Steps
Clone the Repository:

Bash

git clone [YOUR_REPO_URL]
cd amapi
Install Dependencies:

Bash

# Setup and activate virtual environment

python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate

# Install Python dependencies

pip install -r requirements.txt
Configure Environment Variables: Create a .env file and define the following: SECRET_KEY, and all necessary PostgreSQL variables (DB_NAME, DB_USER, DB_PASSWORD, DB_HOST, DB_PORT).

Database Initialization:

Create Initial Roles and Admin: The system requires the Admin and Buyer roles to exist.

Create Roles: Run in the Django shell to ensure Admin and Buyer are in the database.

Bash

python manage.py shell

# >>> from users.models import Role

# >>> Role.objects.get_or_create(name='Admin')

# >>> Role.objects.get_or_create(name='Buyer')

# >>> exit()

Create Superuser: Run python manage.py createsuperuser. After creation, log into the Django Admin (/admin/) and manually set the user's Role to Admin.

Run the Server:

Bash

python manage.py runserver
